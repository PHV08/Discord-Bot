### updates - long time but i have some news some good and bad, the good news is that i just modified code and added support.js code which when a user will use it it will automatically show him how to support you (the developer) and the bad news is that the "/" slash commands wont work anymore because of some modifications in code it will only intake(able to respond) to $(prefix) commands.
